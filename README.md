# Assignment 2 Part 1 of this assignments goal was to build linear regession models in jupyter notebooks using python and R

  # Source 
    canvas assignment from Dr. Freitas 
  # work done 
     regression data was imported into each kernel
     packages were installed to import, generate plots, and fit linear regression
    the dataset was read into python and R to generate scatter plots 
     they were then fit to a linear regression that was then plotted on to the scatter plot 
     the model was then exvaluated 
    finally the assignment was pushed to github
  # Result
    two png images of with linear regression overlayed 
    
# Assignment 3 Part 2 of the assignment was to convert the notebooks into scripts and run them from the command line for r and python

  # Source
    canvas assignment from Dr. Freitas
 # workdone 
   Part 1 was clone genreated from git hub and branch was generated
   the notebooks were converted to scripts .py and .r
   The regression code was modified to enhance the plots with axis, title, y = mx + b equation for linear regression, and r coefficient 
   the scripts were modified using the given code from the assignments for both languages
  juptyerlab terminal was used to exexcuted the code in the scripts using given code in the assignments
  two png images were generated for both the R and python code
# Result 
    two png images of with linear regression, equation, and titles overlayed
